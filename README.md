#Logistics Last-Mile Delivery Dashboard

## Overview

This project showcases a Tableau dashboard that visualizes real-time data related to logistics last-mile delivery. The data used to create the dashboard is a replica of real-world data generated using Excel formulas and the Python Faker library. This makes the dashboard a valuable tool for understanding and improving last-mile delivery operations.

## Key Performance Indicators

The dashboard focuses on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- **Delivery Success Rate**: The ratio of successfully delivered orders to total orders.
- **On-Time Delivery**: The percentage of orders that were delivered within the expected timeframe.
- **Average Delivery Time**: The mean time taken for an order to be delivered.
- **Customer Cancellation Rate**: The proportion of orders cancelled by customers.
- **Rider Cancellation Rate**: The proportion of orders cancelled by delivery riders.

## Visualizations

The dashboard consists of the following visualizations:

- **Total Orders vs Delivered Orders**: A bar chart combined with an area chart illustrating the comparison between total orders and those that were successfully delivered.
- **Delivery Success Rate by Area Zone**: A pie chart showing the distribution of successful deliveries across different area zones.
- **Order Status Summary**: A bar chart that provides a summary of order statuses, including total orders, orders cancelled by customers, orders cancelled by riders, and delivered orders.
- **Delivery Volume by Vehicle Type**: A bar chart demonstrating the number of deliveries made by different types of vehicles, namely bicycles, cars, scooters, and trucks.
- **Deliveries by Day of Week**: A bar chart representing the volume of deliveries made on different days of the week.

This comprehensive dashboard is designed to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of last-mile delivery performance and help identify areas for improvement. All visualizations are interactive, allowing for deeper exploration of the underlying data.
